   You need the IDA Pro SDK to compile the processor module.

   Copy the files to sdk/module/cr16c, open the Visual Studio 6
   project files and start build. 
   Copy Release/cr16c.w32 to procs in your IDA folder.
 
   Sorry, at the moment only a visual Studio 6 project file exists.
   There is a additional Makefile that is a startpoint to compile with another
   compiler.
